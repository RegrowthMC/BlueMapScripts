# BlueMapScripts
This GitHub repo is made with the purpose of housing the custom BlueMap scripts that are used on the [RegrowthMC maps](https://map.regrowthmc.net/)

## Scripts
- **follow-player-query.js** - Adds a `follower_player` query parameter, that accepts a uuid, to automatically track an online player (eg. `https://example.com/?follower_player=58868c0d-3059-462c-8810-cc8eb8c58b54`)

## Usage Instructions
If you would like to use any of the scripts in the repo you can simply download their files and add them to your BlueMap project by following their [guide](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/community/Customisation.html#custom-scripts-behaviour).
